### Main files used

Our implementation consists mostly of the following files:

ezfs.h : This was provided to us and defines many structures used in the assignment.

myez.c : This includes the source code implementation of our filesystem.

format_disk_as_ezfs.c : This file implements a utility for formatting a block device
into an EZFS file system.

### Our solution and assumptions made

We do not believe our solution significantly differs from the assignment, and we have
not made many significant assumptions.
